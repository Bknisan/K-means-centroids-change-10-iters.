# K-means-centroids-change-10-iters.


K_means algorithm for image compression.

instructions:

download python 3.6
libraries:
numpy
scipy

1. provide the algorithm .jpeg image
2. line 59 in the .py file change the path variable to your own image name.
3. run the .py file.
4. the programm will write to your output steam in the following format:
    **number of centroid: X**
     **iter Y: [value, value, value] .......**
     
you can use pandas and matplot in order to show your new modified images based on the number of centroids and their initial position.
